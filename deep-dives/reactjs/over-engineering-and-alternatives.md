# Are We Over-Engineering?

## Overview

In the rush to use modern tools, teams sometimes choose frameworks like React or Next.js for projects that could be solved with simpler technologies like vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

## When Over-Engineering Happens

1. **Static Sites**: Using React for static marketing pages that could be built with a static site generator or just HTML/CSS.
2. **Small Projects**: Introducing complex state management (e.g., Redux) for applications with minimal state.
3. **Premature Optimization**: Adopting tools for scaling problems that may never occur.

## Questions to Ask

1. Can the project be solved with just vanilla technologies?
2. Does the team have the bandwidth to manage the complexity introduced by the chosen tools?
3. Are we solving problems that donâ€™t yet exist?

## Interview Questions

1. Describe a situation where you opted not to use a popular framework. Why?
2. How do you decide between using vanilla technologies and a framework like React?
3. Have you seen examples of over-engineering in a past project? How was it addressed?
