# Why React?

## Overview

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its declarative nature and component-based design have made it a go-to solution for modern frontend development.

## Key Reasons to Use React

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Encourages reusable, isolated pieces of UI.
2. **Declarative Approach**: Simplifies complex UIs by focusing on what should be rendered, not how.
3. **Performance**: The Virtual DOM optimizes updates and minimizes direct DOM manipulation.
4. **Ecosystem**: React's ecosystem includes tools like Redux, React Router, and hooks for managing state and side effects.
5. **Flexibility**: Can be used in various environments, including web, mobile (React Native), and even VR.

## Challenges

- **Overhead**: Setting up React for small projects may be overkill.
- **Learning Curve**: While flexible, React’s ecosystem can overwhelm newcomers.
- **Boilerplate**: State management libraries (like Redux) can introduce unnecessary complexity.

## Questions to Ask

1. Does the project require dynamic, interactive UI updates?
2. Is a component-based architecture beneficial for this project?
3. Could simpler tools like vanilla JS or a smaller library (e.g., Alpine.js) achieve the same results?

## Interview Questions

1. Why is React considered declarative? Compare it with imperative programming.
2. When would you recommend not using React for a project?
3. Explain how the Virtual DOM works and its advantages.
4. How does React’s component model differ from traditional MVC frameworks?

TODO:

1. diffing algorithm and reconciliation
2. where does diffing happen (is that it happens between the virtual and real DOM or it happens in only the virtual dom (prev changes and current chnages))
