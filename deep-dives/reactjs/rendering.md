# Understanding React Rendering

## **1. Transpilation (JSX â†’ JavaScript)**

Before React even starts rendering, JSX must be **transpiled** by **Babel** because browsers do not understand JSX. JSX is an **extension of JavaScript** that allows us to write markup within JavaScript. It is often called **syntactic sugar** for `React.createElement()`.

Once this conversion happens, React takes over the rendering process.

## **2. What Triggers React Rendering?**

React re-renders a component when:  
âœ… The **component mounts (first render)**.  
âœ… The **state changes** (e.g., `useState`, `useReducer`).  
âœ… The **props change**.  
âœ… The **context changes** (if using `useContext`).  
âœ… A **parent component re-renders**, causing a child component to update.

## **3. React Rendering Process**

Once React detects that a component needs to render, it follows these steps:

### **Step 1: React Element Processing**

- React calls the **React element**. This element has three important properties:
  - `type` â†’ Determines whether it's an HTML tag (`div`, `p`) or a component (`MyComponent`).
  - `props` â†’ Contains attributes and children elements.
  - `children` â†’ Nested elements inside the component.

### **Step 2: Checking the Type Property**

- If `type` is a **string**, React directly creates a **DOM node**.
- If `type` is a **function**, React recognizes it as a **component**, calls the function, and extracts its elements **recursively**.

#### **Why is Recursion Used?**

React **uses recursion** to handle deeply nested components efficiently.

- If a loop were used, it would require an additional nested loop to process child components, leading to **poor time complexity**.
- Recursion **naturally** traverses and processes all elements in a **tree-like structure**, making it ideal for rendering the Virtual DOM.

### **Step 3: Virtual DOM Creation**

React uses the extracted elements to create a **new Virtual DOM (vDOM)** while keeping a **copy of the old vDOM**.

### **Step 4: Diffing Algorithm**

React **compares** the new vDOM with the old vDOM and finds the differences. This process is called **diffing**.

### **Step 5: Reconciliation (Updating the Real DOM)**

React applies the **calculated changes** from the diffing step to the **real DOM**. This process is called **reconciliation**.

## **4. Additional React Performance Concepts**

### **Batching**

React **batches multiple state updates** into a single render cycle to **reduce re-renders** and improve performance.

- Previously, batching occurred **only in event handlers**.
- **React 18 introduced automatic batching**, meaning updates from async operations (e.g., promises, setTimeout) are also batched.

### **Fiber Architecture**

React **Fiber** is a reimplementation of React's **reconciliation algorithm** that improves rendering performance.

- **Prior to Fiber**, rendering was synchronous and could cause UI blocking.
- **With Fiber**, React can split rendering into chunks, pausing and resuming work when needed.

### **Concurrent Rendering**

Concurrent rendering is an optimization introduced in **React 18** that allows React to **work on multiple tasks simultaneously**.

- It prevents the UI from being blocked by heavy computations.
- React **prioritizes rendering work** so that user interactions remain responsive.

### **Memoization**

Memoization is an **optimization technique** used to **avoid unnecessary re-renders**.

- **React.memo** is used for **memoizing functional components**.
- **useMemo** is used to **memoize values** to prevent expensive recalculations.
- **useCallback** is used to **memoize functions**, preventing them from being recreated on every render.

### **Selective Rendering**

Selective rendering means React **only updates parts of the UI that actually change**.

- **Keys** help React identify which list items **changed, were added, or were removed**.
- **Pure components and React.memo** ensure components **only re-render when needed**.

## **5. Summary of the React Rendering Flow**

1. **Transpilation**: JSX is converted into JavaScript that the browser understands.
2. **React calls the component function** if it's a function component.
3. **Extracts all DOM node elements** recursively.
4. **Creates a new Virtual DOM**.
5. **Compares it with the previous Virtual DOM (diffing algorithm)**.
6. **Updates only the changed parts** in the real DOM (reconciliation).

**With optimizations like batching, Fiber, concurrent rendering, memoization, and selective rendering, React ensures high performance and efficiency.** ðŸŽ¯

so this is me explaining react rendering

rendering is ususally trigerred by chnage in stage -props, state, etc. when reacts dects a chnage in state it calls the render method, this method comes with a series of steps

- calls the react element, this element has some importand properties we need to take note of (type, prop and children), our main focus will be on the type property, react checks for the type and if its a string, it gets the DOM node elements but if its a function then its a component since react components are functions that return jsx, it calls the function and extracts the DOM node elements recursively until it gets all DOM node elements including nested components and etc. react uses the extracted elements to create a new vDOM while keeping a copy of the old vDOM, it compares the two vDOMs to find the difference or chnages, this stage is called diffing and uses an algorithmic design called the diffing algorithm (diffing = difference), after getting the difference react uses it to reconcile the real DOM, this process is also called reconciliation, that that is where the chnaged part are updated on the UI,
