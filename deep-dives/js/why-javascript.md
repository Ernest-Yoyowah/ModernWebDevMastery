# Why JavaScript?

## Overview

JavaScript (JS) is the backbone of modern web development, enabling dynamic and interactive behavior in web applications. Its ubiquity and versatility make it indispensable for both client-side and server-side programming.

## Key Reasons to Use JS

1. **Web Standard**: JavaScript is natively supported by all modern browsers, making it the de facto language for web development.
2. **Dynamic Interactivity**: Enables real-time updates, DOM manipulation, animations, and event handling for rich user experiences.
3. **Versatility**: Runs across platforms (frontend and backend) via Node.js and even on non-browser environments (e.g., IoT devices).
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) make development faster and more robust.
5. **Asynchronous Programming**: Promises, async/await, and event-driven architecture support modern, scalable applications.

## Challenges

- **Weak Typing**: Increases the risk of runtime errors.
- **Complexity**: Large, unstructured codebases can become unmanageable without discipline.
- **Browser Compatibility Issues**: While modern browsers are standardized, legacy support may still require polyfills.

## Questions to Ask

1. Would a static HTML/CSS-only solution suffice for the problem at hand?
2. Can you justify the use of JS for this feature? For example:
   - Is interactivity needed?
   - Does it involve asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls)?
3. Are there better-suited alternatives (e.g., WASM for performance-critical tasks)?

## Interview Questions

1. Why is JavaScript considered a "non-blocking" language? Explain its event loop.
2. What are the trade-offs of JavaScript's dynamic typing?
3. How do you decide when to use vanilla JS over a framework like React?
4. What are some situations where JS would not be the best choice for a project?

TODO:

1. understanding Polyfills
2. JavaScript is natively supported by all modern browsers, yes we know, we've heard that js is the language of the web but what does that even mean, if you say that js is natively supported, what does it mean, isnt python also suppprt through django and java through spring boot
