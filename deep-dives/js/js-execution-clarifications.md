# Clarifications on Execution by the "JavaScript VM"

## JavaScript VM vs Engine

- The term "JavaScript Virtual Machine (VM)" is often used interchangeably with the **JavaScript engine** (e.g., V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore).
- **Engines like V8** contain components that handle all stages of processing, including parsing, compiling, and executing the code.
- The **execution phase** specifically is handled by a **low-level execution unit** in the engine (e.g., **Ignition in V8**, which acts as the interpreter).
- **JIT compilation** is not about direct execution but about optimizing the code to produce machine-level instructions for faster performance. Execution happens through the **interpreters and optimized machine code** generated by the engine.

### Key Clarification

The "JavaScript VM" isn't a standalone program; it's a **conceptual representation** of the runtime environment within the JavaScript engine that handles execution.

### Is it a mistake?

- Not entirely, but referring to a "JavaScript VM" as a separate entity might create confusion.
- Instead, you could clarify that **execution happens as part of the JavaScript engine's runtime execution environment**, such as Ignition in V8.

## To-Do: Ignition, TurboFan, and Optimization Techniques

These components are central to **V8's engine pipeline**. Here's a breakdown:

### Ignition (Interpreter)

- **Role**: Ignition is V8's interpreter. It reads the **Intermediate Representation (IR)** (in V8, it's called Bytecode) and starts execution immediately.
- **Why it matters**: Ignition allows the program to run **quickly** without waiting for full JIT compilation.
- **Process**:
  1. Ignition reads the bytecode generated by the parser. (so this statement is wrong bro)
  2. Executes it directly while monitoring hotspots (frequently executed parts of the code).

### TurboFan (JIT Compiler)

- **Role**: TurboFan is V8’s **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**, responsible for optimizing **hot code** (parts of the code executed frequently).
- **How it works**:
  - During execution, Ignition profiles the program and identifies performance-critical sections.
  - These sections are passed to TurboFan, which generates **optimized machine code** tailored to the specific workload.
- **Why it matters**: TurboFan ensures that JavaScript executes efficiently, especially for compute-intensive operations.

### Optimization Techniques

TurboFan applies various optimization strategies, including:

- **Inline caching**: Speeding up property lookups for frequently accessed objects.
- **Function inlining**: Reducing the overhead of function calls.
- **Dead code elimination**: Removing code that doesn't impact the program.
- **Loop unrolling**: Replacing iterative loops with a series of direct instructions.
- **Speculative optimization**: Making assumptions about data types to optimize code paths, with a mechanism to revert if assumptions are wrong (deoptimization).

## Updated Process with Ignition and TurboFan

You can revise your process as follows:

1. **Intermediate Representation**: After parsing, the code is converted into **bytecode**, which is a form of IR.
2. **Ignition Execution**: Ignition interprets the bytecode and begins execution immediately while profiling the program.
3. **Optimization by TurboFan**:
   - TurboFan optimizes the bytecode by compiling "hot code" into efficient machine code for faster performance.
   - Optimizations improve runtime speed, especially for compute-heavy tasks.

To dive deeper:

1. **Ignition and TurboFan**:

   - Read the [V8 blog on Ignition](https://v8.dev/blog/ignition-interpreter).
   - Explore the [TurboFan introduction](https://v8.dev/blog/turbofan-jit).

2. **Optimization Techniques**:

   - Review V8’s [performance tips](https://v8.dev/docs).
   - Practice identifying and fixing bottlenecks in code (e.g., using Chrome DevTools).

3. **Experiment**:
   - Write a program with loops, recursion, and frequent property lookups.
   - Observe how V8 optimizes these using tools like `--trace-opt` and `--trace-deopt`.
