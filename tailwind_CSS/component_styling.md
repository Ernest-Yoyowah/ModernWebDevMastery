# Component Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS allows you to create reusable components by composing utility classes. Here's how to style components using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Component Structure:**

   - Structure your components using HTML elements and apply utility classes directly to them.

2. **Reusable Styles:**

   - Identify common styles used across multiple components and create utility classes for them. For example, create a `btn` class for button styles.

3. **Responsive Design:**

   - Use responsive variants of utility classes to create components that adapt to different screen sizes.

4. **Scoped Styling:**
   - Encapsulate component styles by applying utility classes within the component's scope. Avoid using global styles to ensure consistency and maintainability.
