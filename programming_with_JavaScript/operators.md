# Operators in JavaScript

## Overview:

Operators in JavaScript perform operations on variables and values. They allow for arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other types of operations.

## Types of Operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**

   - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulus (`%`).

2. **Comparison Operators:**

   - Equal to (`==`), Not equal to (`!=`), Strict equal to (`===`), Strict not equal to (`!==`), Greater than (`>`), Less than (`<`), Greater than or equal to (`>=`), Less than or equal to (`<=`).

3. **Logical Operators:**

   - AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), NOT (`!`).

4. **Assignment Operators:**

   - Assign a value (`=`), Add and assign (`+=`), Subtract and assign (`-=`), Multiply and assign (`*=`), Divide and assign (`/=`).

5. **Increment and Decrement Operators:**
   - Increment (`++`), Decrement (`--`).

## Operator Precedence:

Understanding the order in which operators are evaluated.

## Example:

```javascript
// Arithmetic operators
let sum = 10 + 5;

// Comparison operators
let isEqual = sum === 15;

// Logical operators
let isTrue = true && false;

// Assignment operators
let x = 10;
x += 5; // x is now 15
```
