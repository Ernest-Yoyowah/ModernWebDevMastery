# What is JavaScript?

## Overview:

JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily known for its use in web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to websites.

## Key Features:

1. **Client-Side Scripting:**

   - JavaScript is primarily executed on the client's browser, enabling dynamic updates without requiring a page reload.

2. **Object-Oriented:**

   - Supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing the creation of reusable and modular code.

3. **Event-Driven:**

   - Reacts to user actions or events on a webpage, facilitating interactive user experiences.

4. **Versatility:**
   - Used not only for web development but also in server-side development (Node.js), mobile app development (React Native), and more.

## History:

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape. Over the years, it has evolved, and ECMAScript serves as the standard specification for JavaScript.

## Usage:

JavaScript is an essential language for front-end web development, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
