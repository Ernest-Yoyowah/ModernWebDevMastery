# Variables in JavaScript

## Overview:

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They act as containers for holding values, making it easier to work with and manipulate data in a program.

## Declaration and Initialization:

1. **Variable Declaration:**

   - Declaring a variable using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - Assigning a value to a variable during or after declaration.

## Data Types:

Understanding how to declare and initialize variables of different data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, and objects.

## Variable Scope:

1. **Global Scope:**

   - Variables declared outside any function, accessible throughout the entire program.

2. **Local Scope:**
   - Variables declared within a function, only accessible within that function.

## Naming Conventions:

Best practices for naming variables, including using meaningful names and following naming conventions.

## Example:

```javascript
// Variable declaration and initialization
let greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Output the variable value
console.log(greeting);
```
