# Data Types in JavaScript

## Overview:

In JavaScript, data types define the types of values that variables can hold. Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming and data manipulation.

## Primitive Data Types:

1. **String:**

   - Represents textual data and is enclosed in single or double quotes.

2. **Number:**

   - Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

3. **Boolean:**

   - Represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.

4. **Undefined:**

   - Represents an uninitialized variable or missing value.

5. **Null:**

   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

6. **Symbol:**
   - Introduced in ECMAScript 6, represents a unique and immutable value.

## Composite Data Types:

1. **Object:**

   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs and is used to store complex data structures.

2. **Array:**
   - Represents an ordered collection of values, and each value is assigned a numeric index.

## Type Coercion:

JavaScript performs type coercion automatically, converting values between data types during certain operations.

## Dynamic Typing:

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
