# Static and Dynamic Content in React

React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enables developers to create applications with both static and dynamic content. Understanding the concepts of static and dynamic content is fundamental to working with React.

## Static Content:

1. **JSX (JavaScript XML):**

   - React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to define static content. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

2. **Components:**
   - Components are the building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate static content and can be reused throughout the application.

## Dynamic Content:

1. **State:**

   - React components can have state, which represents the dynamic data in a component. When state changes, React efficiently updates the DOM to reflect those changes.

2. **Props (Properties):**

   - Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This mechanism enables dynamic content to be passed down the component tree.

3. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - React allows developers to conditionally render components based on certain conditions. This is a powerful feature for displaying content dynamically.

Understanding the interplay between static and dynamic content is crucial for building React applications with rich user interfaces.
