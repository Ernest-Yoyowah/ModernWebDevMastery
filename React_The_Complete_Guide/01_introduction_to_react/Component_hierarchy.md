# Component Hierarchy in React

In React, applications are built using a hierarchical structure of components, where each component encapsulates a specific piece of functionality or UI element. Understanding component hierarchy is essential for designing scalable and maintainable React applications.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Parent and Child Components:**

   - Components in React can be classified as parent or child components based on their relationships within the hierarchy. A parent component can contain multiple child components.

2. **Tree-like Structure:**

   - The component hierarchy forms a tree-like structure, where the root component represents the entire application, and each subsequent level represents more granular components.

3. **Data Flow:**

   - Data and state can flow down the component hierarchy from parent components to their children. Changes in state at higher levels can impact the UI of child components.

4. **Reusability:**
   - Components can be reused throughout the application, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase. Reusable components enhance code reusability and reduce redundancy.

## Example Component Hierarchy:

```plaintext
- App (Root Component)
  - Header
  - MainContent
    - ArticleList
      - Article
    - Sidebar
  - Footer
```
