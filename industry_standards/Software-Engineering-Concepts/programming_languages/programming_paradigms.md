# Programming Paradigms

This file contains information about various programming paradigms and concepts.

## Imperative vs. Declarative Programming

Imperative and declarative programming are two contrasting programming paradigms that describe different approaches to writing code.

### Imperative Programming

In imperative programming, the focus is on describing how to achieve a task step by step. Programs are written as sequences of commands that explicitly define the execution flow and manipulate mutable state.

### Declarative Programming

In declarative programming, the focus is on describing what needs to be achieved rather than how to achieve it. Programs are written in a more abstract and concise manner, often using high-level abstractions and declarative constructs.

### Comparison

- **Imperative**: Programs describe detailed steps and control flow.
- **Declarative**: Programs describe the desired outcome without specifying detailed steps.

Imperative programming is more procedural and closely resembles how a computer executes instructions. Declarative programming, on the other hand, emphasizes what should be achieved rather than how to achieve it, leading to more concise and expressive code.
