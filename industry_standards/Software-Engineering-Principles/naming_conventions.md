# Project Naming Conventions

## Files and Folders

- lowercase letters and underscore to separate words: `my_file_name.js`, `my-folder-name`
- Avoid special characters and spaces in file and folder names
- Be descriptive and meaningful in naming to convey the purpose or content of the file or folder

## Variables

- Use meaningful and descriptive names that indicate the purpose or content of the variable
- Use camelCase convention for variable names: `myVariableName`, `userName`, `totalItemCount`
- Avoid using single-letter variable names unless they are used in simple loop constructs

## Booleans

- Start boolean variable names with `is`, `has`, `can`, or similar prefixes to indicate their boolean nature: `isFinished`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`
- Use meaningful names that convey the condition being represented

## Constants

- Use uppercase letters and underscores to separate words: `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `API_ENDPOINT`
- Constants should represent values that are not expected to change during the execution of the program
- Use descriptive names that convey the purpose or significance of the constant

## Functions

- Use camelCase convention for function names: `calculateTotal`, `getUserInfo`, `validateInput`
- Function names should be descriptive and indicate the action or purpose of the function
- Choose verbs or verb phrases that accurately describe what the function does

## Classes

- Use PascalCase convention for class names: `MyClassName`, `UserService`, `ProductModel`
- Class names should be descriptive and represent a singular, self-contained entity or concept
- Use nouns or noun phrases that accurately describe the nature or purpose of the class

## CSS Class Names

- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) convention for CSS class names
- Blocks represent higher-level components or sections of the UI (e.g., `nav-logo`)
- Elements represent specific parts or elements within blocks, separated by double underscores `__` (e.g., `nav-logo__img`)
